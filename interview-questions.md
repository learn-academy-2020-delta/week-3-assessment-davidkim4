# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Separates an object into individual variables so that the objects key can be called on a little easier.

  Researched answer: Essentialy unpacks the values from arrays or objects into individual variables.



2. What are React lifecycle methods? Provide three examples.

  Your answer: I'm not too sure what the 3 lifecycle methods were called, but I believe it refers to the different phases a react component undergoes to execute any sort of change.

  Researched answer: The React Lifecycle methods are used to monitor and manipulate a React Component. The three phases are mounting, updating, and unmounting. An example of mounting is the construcor() method which holds the components initial state and any other initial values. An example of updating is the render() method which holds all the components that you want to portray on the webpage. An example of unmounting is the componentWillUnmount() method that will remove a component from the DOM.



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class holds all the objects and methods that can change your objects. Objects are instances of clases that go through the methods of a class.

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint for objects. It defines object properties and describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either define or you can change dynamically.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: HTML div is a blocl section of an HTML page that holds other data. I'm not too sure what a span is since I've yet to use one, but I can assume it is slightly similar to a div.

  Researched answer: divs are used for dividing elements that are block-line, whereas span is used for grouping inline elements.



5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: React.Fragment is a tag that holds all the calls to a child component. You use it so that you don't have to make multiple divs on a webpage.

  Researched answer: React.Fragment holds multiple elements. It is used to group a list of child components without adding extra nodes into the DOM.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: I have absolutely no idea what options there are for responsive designs. But I believe the term responsive design refers to how an interface should change in response to a users actions and portray information to accurately represent the users goal.

  Researched answer: The 3 options for creating a responsive design are flexible layouts (where page components morph to accomodate the size of the screen), media queries (allow designers to specify different styles for specific browsers and device circumstances), and flexible media (changes the size of the portrayed media to fit accurately on any screen width). 



7. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props are used to define a variable of a child component. This way, the child component can call on that prop to gain access to the objects in its parent component.

  Researched answer: props is a keyword in react for passing info from the parent component to the child. 



8. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: this is a keyword used to refer back to an object it belongs to.

  Researched answer: refers to an object, that object which is executing the current bit of javascript code.



9. STRETCH: What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

  Your answer: ternary operator in javascript is used as a simpler way to write an if else statement, only if there are 2 possible outcomes.

  Researched answer: Ternary operators are handy shortcuts for creating if/else statements in JavaScript. Ternary operators allow JavaScript developers to make very clean and concise code.



10. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Not too sure, but I think it is a function that doesn't take in an argument.

  Researched answer: Anonymous functions are functions without a name and is not accessible after its initial creation.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Ruby: a scripting language used for building web applications.
- Object oriented programming: a computer programming model that organized software design around data, or objects rather than funcion and logic.
- RSpec: a computer domain specific language testing tool written in Ruby so that you can test Ruby code.
- Instance variable: variables that are defined in a class where each object of the class has its own copy of the instance variables. They are created outside the counstructors and methods, or blocks in the class.
- Ruby blocks: a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call.
- Ruby hashes: a collection of key-value pairs. Similar to an array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.
- `getter` and `setter` methods in Ruby: allows developers to access a class's instance variable from outside the class. Getter methods are used to get the value of an instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of an instance variable of some class.
